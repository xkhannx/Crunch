# Crunch (2020)
 
An prototype for a mobile game that we played around with and decided it wasn't worth completing. Done in cooperation with talented [Abylay Mukhit](https://abylaymukhit.itch.io/), who was the artist and designer. To try this project out, go to Scenes/MainMenu.unity and hit Play. This will take you to the list of levels and allow you to create new levels or edit or play existing ones.

This game is a shooter, where you control the crosshair by using a small dashboard at the bottom. Click on the dashboard screen to show the crosshair and release to shoot. Kill all aliens before they consume all your gold! The editor allows you to create layouts, place coins and enemy spawn points. The map data is saved as binary files to the app persitent path.

Feel free to use the code, but don't use the art assets without permission.

The projects that we did get around to publish:

- [STYX: Vertical platformer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/styx-vertical-platformer/id1587424131)
